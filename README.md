# RGBImageCutter
Cuts an image into a grid, and checks per cell what the dominant RGB value is. Visually displayed and RGB values sent to a database. The use-case for this project was using images of heatmap data of people on a specific floor. The RGB data of this heatmap was then used by a microprocessor with led strips in order to visually display the heatmap data.
